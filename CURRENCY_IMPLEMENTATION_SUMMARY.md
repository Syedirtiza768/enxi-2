# Currency Implementation Summary

## Overview
The system has been updated to properly support multiple currencies, with AED (UAE Dirham) configured as the default currency instead of hardcoded USD.

## Changes Made

### 1. Currency Infrastructure
- **Created centralized currency utility** (`/lib/utils/currency.ts`)
  - Supports 12 currencies including AED, USD, EUR, GBP, PKR, etc.
  - Provides consistent formatting functions
  - Handles currency symbols and parsing

- **Enhanced Currency Context** (`/lib/contexts/currency-context.tsx`)
  - Fetches default currency from company settings
  - Updates global currency utility when settings change
  - Listens for company settings changes via custom events

### 2. Fixed Hardcoded Currency (83 files updated)
- **Automated fixes using script** (`/scripts/fix-currency-formatting.ts`)
  - Replaced hardcoded `currency: 'USD'` with dynamic currency
  - Updated `Intl.NumberFormat` calls
  - Added currency context imports where needed

- **Key components updated:**
  - All page components in `/app/(auth)/`
  - UI components in `/components/`
  - PDF generation for quotations
  - Service files for proper currency handling

### 3. Company Settings Integration
- Company settings already support currency configuration
- Default currency can be changed via Settings > Company page
- Changes are immediately reflected throughout the system

## How Currency Works Now

1. **System Default**: Configured in CompanySettings table (currently AED)
2. **Entity-Specific**: Each customer, invoice, quotation can have its own currency
3. **Display**: All UI components use the configured currency from context
4. **PDF Generation**: Uses the currency from the specific document (quotation/invoice)

## Testing Currency Changes

1. **Via UI:**
   - Navigate to `/settings/company`
   - Change "Default Currency" to desired currency (e.g., AED)
   - Save settings
   - All new documents will use the selected currency

2. **Verification:**
   - Check quotations page - amounts show in AED
   - Check invoices page - amounts show in AED
   - Create new quotation - uses AED by default
   - Generate PDF - shows AED currency

## Supported Currencies
- USD - US Dollar
- EUR - Euro
- GBP - British Pound
- **AED - UAE Dirham** (current default)
- PKR - Pakistani Rupee
- CAD - Canadian Dollar
- AUD - Australian Dollar
- JPY - Japanese Yen
- CHF - Swiss Franc
- CNY - Chinese Yuan
- INR - Indian Rupee
- NZD - New Zealand Dollar

## Notes
- The system maintains backward compatibility
- Existing documents keep their original currency
- Only new documents use the updated default currency
- Currency conversion features are available but not automatically applied
