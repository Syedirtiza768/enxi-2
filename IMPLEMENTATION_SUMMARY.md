- Full-featured item creation form
- Supports all item types (Product, Service, Raw Material)
- Includes inventory tracking, pricing, GL accounts
- Initial stock creation with movements
- Comprehensive validation

### 2. ItemSelectorModalEnhanced (`/components/inventory/item-selector-modal-enhanced.tsx`)
- Advanced item search and selection modal
- Integrated quick item creation
- Multi-select capability
- Advanced filtering (category, price, stock status)
- Real-time search with debouncing

### 3. LineItemEditorV3 (`/components/quotations/line-item-editor-v3.tsx`)
- Enhanced line editor for quotations and sales orders

## Integration Points

### 1. Quotation Form
- File: `/components/quotations/quotation-form-clean.tsx`
- Replaced `LineBasedItemEditor` with `LineItemEditorV3`

### 2. Sales Order Form
- File: `/components/sales-orders/sales-order-line-editor.tsx`

## Error Fixes Applied

### "P.map is not a function" Resolution
1. Added defensive data extraction for API responses:
   ```typescript
   const data = response.data?.data || response.data || []
   ```

2. Added Array.isArray() checks before all .map() calls:
   ```typescript
   Array.isArray(categories) && categories.map(...)
   ```

3. Ensured all array state variables have default empty arrays:
   ```typescript
   categories: Array.isArray(categories) ? categories : []
   ```
