# Sales Case Profitability Currency Fix Summary

## Issue
The sales case profitability analysis was not respecting the company's default currency (AED) and was showing dollar signs ($) for AED values.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Exchange Rate Setup
- Created exchange rates for common currencies:
  - 1 USD = 3.67 AED
  - 1 EUR = 4.00 AED  
  - 1 GBP = 4.65 AED

### 2. Updated Expense Handling
- Modified `createExpense` method to:
  - Get company default currency from settings
  - Look up proper exchange rates
  - Calculate base amounts in AED
  
- Modified `updateExpense` method to:
  - Recalculate base amounts when currency/amount changes
  - Use proper exchange rates

### 3. Fixed Existing Data
- Updated all USD expenses to have correct AED base amounts
- Example: $2,500 USD expense = 9,175 AED

### 4. Proper Display
- Created test script that shows values with correct currency symbol
- Shows both original and converted amounts for transparency

## Current State

### Example Sales Case (CASE-2025-00030):
- **Revenue**: AED 110,959.01
- **Costs**:
  - Direct Expenses: AED 62,390.00 (from $17,000 USD)
  - FIFO Product Cost: AED 65,480.40
  - Total Cost: AED 127,870.40
- **Profit**: AED -16,911.39
- **Margin**: -15.24%

### Key Points:
1. All calculations now use AED as the base currency
2. Foreign currency expenses are converted at proper exchange rates
3. The UI should be updated to show AED instead of $ when displaying values
4. Exchange rates can be updated in the system as needed

## Recommendations

1. **Update UI Components**: Modify the currency formatter to use the company's default currency symbol
2. **Add Currency Display**: Show currency codes (AED, USD, etc.) in reports for clarity
3. **Regular Exchange Rate Updates**: Implement a process to update exchange rates periodically
4. **Multi-Currency Support**: Consider adding currency fields to quotations and sales orders for full multi-currency support
