# Implementation and Support

## Approach
1. **Assessment** – Review existing processes and data structures.
2. **Configuration** – Map Chart of Accounts, inventory locations, and user roles.
3. **Migration** – Import master data and opening balances.
4. **Training** – Hands-on sessions for key users followed by wider rollout.
5. **Go-Live** – Monitor transactions, adjust workflows, and confirm reporting.

```
Assessment -> Configuration -> Migration -> Training -> Go-Live
```

## Ongoing Support
- Dedicated support channel with response targets
- Regular system health checks and database backups
- Optional managed hosting with PM2 process management

## Scalability Considerations
- Add modules over time without code rewrites
- Ready for PostgreSQL or cloud databases
- Clear service boundaries simplify future microservices
