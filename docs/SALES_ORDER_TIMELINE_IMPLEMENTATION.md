# Sales Order Timeline Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive timeline system for Sales Orders, including the workflow from Sales Order → Shipment → Invoice.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Timeline Service
- **File**: `/lib/services/sales-order-timeline.service.ts`
- Fetches timeline events from multiple sources:
  - Audit logs for order-level events
  - Shipment records for shipping events
  - Invoice records for billing events
  - Payment records for payment events
- Provides a unified timeline view with proper sorting and metadata

### 2. Timeline API Endpoint
- **File**: `/app/api/sales-orders/[id]/timeline/route.ts`
- RESTful endpoint to fetch timeline data
- Returns events in chronological order

### 3. Enhanced Timeline Component
- **File**: `/components/sales-orders/order-timeline-enhanced.tsx`
- Interactive timeline visualization with:
  - Event filtering (All vs Key Events)
  - Expandable/collapsible view
  - Color-coded event types
  - Relative timestamps
  - Related entity links
  - User attribution

### 4. Workflow Visualization Component
- **File**: `/components/sales-orders/workflow-visualization.tsx`
- Visual workflow representation showing:
  - Current order status
  - Completed, active, and pending steps
  - Action buttons for next steps
  - Related documents (shipments, invoices)
  - Status-appropriate messaging

### 5. Updated Workflow Status Component
- **File**: `/components/sales-orders/workflow-status.tsx`
- Simplified to use the new WorkflowVisualization component
- Provides navigation to create shipments and invoices

## Workflow Implementation

### Sales Order → Shipment
- Orders must be APPROVED before creating shipments
- Multiple shipments can be created for partial fulfillment
- Each shipment tracks:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Shipping details (carrier, tracking)
  - Delivery confirmation

### Sales Order → Invoice
- Invoices can be created at any time (flexible workflow)
- Support for:
  - Multiple invoices per order
  - Partial invoicing
  - Direct invoice creation without shipment

### Timeline Events Tracked
1. **Order Events**
   - Created
   - Updated
   - Approved
   - Cancelled

2. **Shipment Events**
   - Shipment created
   - Order shipped
   - Order delivered

3. **Invoice Events**
   - Invoice created
   - Payment received

## UI/UX Improvements

### Timeline View
- Clean, vertical timeline layout
- Icons and colors for quick event identification
- Expandable metadata for detailed information
- Filter between all events and key milestones

### Workflow Visualization
- Step-by-step progress indicator
- Clear visual connections between steps
- Action buttons at appropriate stages
- Status badges and contextual messages

## Database Integration
- Utilizes existing AuditLog table for event tracking
- Relationships maintained through:
  - SalesOrder → Shipment
  - SalesOrder → Invoice
  - Invoice → Payment

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time timeline updates using WebSockets
2. Email notifications for key events
3. Custom event types for business-specific workflows
4. Timeline export functionality
5. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
