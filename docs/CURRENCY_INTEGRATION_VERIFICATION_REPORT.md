# Currency Integration Verification Report

## Summary
The sales case profitability analysis has been updated to properly handle multi-currency transactions with AED as the base currency.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Working Correctly

1. **Company Settings**
   - Base currency is correctly set to AED
   - All calculations use AED as the base currency

2. **Exchange Rates**
   - Exchange rates have been set up:
     - 1 USD = 3.67 AED
     - 1 EUR = 4.00 AED
     - 1 GBP = 4.65 AED

3. **Expense Handling**
   - Foreign currency expenses are properly converted to AED
   - Example: $2,500 USD expense = 9,175 AED @ 3.67
   - Total expenses correctly calculated in base currency

4. **GL Accounts**
   - Most accounts (53) are in AED
   - Only specific foreign currency accounts (Cash-USD, Cash-EUR) remain in foreign currency

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

1. **Stock Movements**
   - Stock movements are created but with 0 cost
   - FIFO cost calculation returns 0 for delivered items
   - This affects profitability calculations

2. **Missing Currency Fields**
   - Quotations and Sales Orders don't have currency fields
   - All amounts are assumed to be in customer's currency (AED)

3. **Journal Entry Integration**
   - GL entries don't have direct reference fields to sales cases
   - Makes tracking currency flow through accounting difficult

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix FIFO Cost Calculation**
   - Ensure stock lots have proper unit costs in AED
   - Create stock movements with correct costs when items are delivered
   - Link stock movements to shipments properly

2. **Add Currency Support to Documents**
   - Add currency field to Quotations and Sales Orders
   - Ensure all amounts are stored with their currency
   - Convert to base currency for reporting

### Medium Priority
1. **Improve GL Integration**
   - Add reference fields to journal entries for better tracking
   - Ensure all GL postings use correct currency
   - Create currency gain/loss entries when needed

2. **Enhanced Reporting**
   - Show both original and base currency amounts
   - Add currency conversion details to reports
   - Track profitability by currency

### Low Priority
1. **UI Improvements**
   - Update currency formatter to use company default
   - Show currency codes next to amounts
   - Add tooltips showing conversion rates

## Conclusion

The multi-currency foundation is in place with proper exchange rates and conversion logic. The main issue is the FIFO cost calculation returning 0, which affects profitability accuracy. Once this is resolved, the system will provide accurate multi-currency profitability analysis.
