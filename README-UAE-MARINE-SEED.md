### Option 2: Combine All Parts
1. Copy all functions from the part files:
   - `seed-uae-marine-part2.ts` - Chart of accounts, locations, inventory
   - `seed-uae-marine-part3.ts` - Suppliers, customers, sales setup
   - `seed-uae-marine-part4.ts` - Transactions and workflows

2. Add them to the main `seed-uae-marine.ts` file after the existing functions

3. Run the seed:
```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed-uae-marine.ts
```

### Option 3: Create a Consolidated File
Create a new file that imports all the functions:

```typescript
// seed-uae-marine-full.ts
import { /* all functions */ } from './seed-uae-marine'
import { /* all functions */ } from './seed-uae-marine-part2'
import { /* all functions */ } from './seed-uae-marine-part3'
import { /* all functions */ } from './seed-uae-marine-part4'

// Call main() from seed-uae-marine.ts
```
