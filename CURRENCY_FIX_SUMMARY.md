# Currency Fix Summary - AED Configuration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Currency Display Issue
**Problem**: Quotations were showing USD instead of the configured company currency (AED)
**Root Cause**: The quotation service was using customer currency instead of company default currency

### 2. Files Updated

#### `/lib/services/quotation.service.ts`
- Line 592: Changed from `quotation.salesCase.customer.currency || 'USD'`
- Changed to: `companySettings.defaultCurrency || 'AED'`
- Same fix applied to both client view (line 595) and internal view (line 668)

#### `/app/(auth)/quotations/[id]/page.tsx`
- Line 297-301: Updated formatCurrency function
- Changed from hardcoded 'USD' to dynamic currency from quotation data
- Now uses: `const currency = (quotation as any)?.currency || 'AED'`

### 3. Verification Results

✅ Company Settings: Default Currency = AED
✅ Client View: Now shows AED
✅ Internal View: Now shows AED
✅ PDF Generation: Both views use AED
✅ Customer currency (USD) is properly ignored

### 4. How It Works Now

1. Company has default currency set to AED in settings
2. When generating quotations, the service fetches company settings
3. Uses `companySettings.defaultCurrency` instead of customer currency
4. UI components dynamically use the currency from quotation data
5. PDFs render with correct AED currency

### 5. Test Commands

To verify the fix is working:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-currency-fix.ts
```

This will show:
- Company default currency (AED)
- Customer currency (USD - ignored)
- All views showing AED

### 6. Important Notes

- The system now consistently uses company currency (AED) across all quotation views
- Customer currency is stored but not used for quotation display
- This ensures all quotations use the company's configured currency regardless of customer settings
