- `jspdf` - Has built-in types (`types: "types/index.d.ts"`)
- `recharts` - Has built-in types (`types: "types/index.d.ts"`)
- `web-vitals` - Has built-in types (`typings: "dist/modules/index.d.ts"`)
- `xlsx` - Has built-in types (`types: "types/index.d.ts"`)
- `zod` - Has built-in types (`types: "./dist/types/index.d.ts"`)

### ✅ Packages with @types/ Packages (Already Installed)
- `bcryptjs` - `@types/bcryptjs` ✅
- `jsonwebtoken` - `@types/jsonwebtoken` ✅
- `node` - `@types/node` ✅
- `react` - `@types/react` ✅
- `react-dom` - `@types/react-dom` ✅
- `uuid` - `@types/uuid` ✅
- `jest` - `@types/jest` ✅
- `supertest` - `@types/supertest` ✅

### ✅ Packages with @types/ Packages (Newly Installed)
- `archiver` - `@types/archiver` ✅
- `bcrypt` - `@types/bcrypt` ✅  
- `nodemailer` - `@types/nodemailer` ✅
- `react-window-infinite-loader` - `@types/react-window-infinite-loader` ✅

### ✅ Packages that include types in dependencies
- `@types/node-cron` - Types already listed in dependencies
- `@types/node-fetch` - Types already listed in dependencies
- `@types/papaparse` - Types already listed in dependencies
- `@types/react-day-picker` - Types already listed in dependencies
- `@types/react-window` - Types already listed in dependencies

### 📦 Framework/UI Libraries (TypeScript Native)
- `next` - TypeScript native
- `react` - TypeScript support via @types/react
- `@radix-ui/*` - All Radix UI components have built-in TypeScript support
- `@prisma/client` - Generated types from Prisma schema
- `@faker-js/faker` - Built-in TypeScript support
- `lucide-react` - Built-in TypeScript support

### 🔧 Build Tools & Dev Dependencies (Type Support Not Required)
- `autoprefixer` - Build tool, no types needed
- `postcss` - Build tool, no types needed  
- `tailwindcss` - Build tool, no types needed
- `eslint` - Dev tool with own type system
- `tsx` - TypeScript runner, no additional types needed

### ⚠️ Custom Type Declarations Created
- `papaparse` - Custom module declaration in `/types/global.d.ts`

## Issues Resolved

1. **Missing @types packages**: Installed `@types/archiver`, `@types/nodemailer`, `@types/bcrypt`, `@types/react-window-infinite-loader`

2. **Custom type declarations**: Created `/types/global.d.ts` for packages that don't have complete type definitions

3. **TypeScript configuration**: Updated `tsconfig.json` to include the `/types` directory

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Checked all major dependencies for built-in TypeScript support
2. ✅ Installed missing @types packages where available
3. ✅ Created custom module declarations where needed
4. ✅ Updated TypeScript configuration to include custom types
5. ✅ Verified all import statements use properly typed modules

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All third-party libraries now have proper TypeScript type definitions through:
- Built-in types (preferred)
- Official @types packages from DefinitelyTyped
- Custom module declarations where necessary

### Verification Results
- ✅ All major third-party imports can be resolved by TypeScript
- ✅ Type definitions are properly loaded for archiver, nodemailer, bcrypt
- ✅ Built-in types working for html2canvas, jspdf, axios, recharts, etc.
- ✅ Custom papaparse declarations in `/types/global.d.ts` are accessible
- ✅ TypeScript configuration updated to include custom types

The codebase now has complete type coverage for all third-party dependencies. Any remaining TypeScript errors would be related to:
- Code-specific type safety issues (not missing library types)
- Path resolution configuration
- Component prop type mismatches

**All third-party type declaration issues have been resolved.**
