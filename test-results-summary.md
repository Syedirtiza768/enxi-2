# Test Results Summary

## 📊 Overview
Date: 2025-06-28
Total Test Suites Run: 4 categories

## 🧪 Test Categories

### 1. E2E Tests (Playwright)
**Status**: ❌ Failed  
**Total Tests**: 214 tests configured  
**Tests Run**: 4 (3 auth setup + 1 cleanup)  
**Passed**: 1 (cleanup)  
**Failed**: 3 (auth setup)  
**Not Run**: 210 (blocked by auth setup failure)  

**Key Issues**:
- Authentication setup tests failed due to login redirect timeout
- Dev server may not be using the test database correctly
- All main E2E tests blocked by authentication setup failure

**Failed Tests**:
- `[setup] › e2e/setup/auth.setup.ts:13:6 › authenticate as admin`
- `[setup] › e2e/setup/auth.setup.ts:40:6 › authenticate as manager`
- `[setup] › e2e/setup/auth.setup.ts:67:6 › authenticate as sales user`

### 2. Unit Tests (Jest)
**Status**: ⚠️ Mixed Results  
**Total Test Suites**: Multiple suites attempted  
**Key Results**:
- ✅ Simple test suite: 2/2 tests passed
- ❌ Multiple component tests failed due to:
  - Missing mock implementations
  - React act() warnings
  - Prisma client browser environment issues
  - Syntax errors in some test files

**Notable Failures**:
- `tests/integration/end-to-end-p2p-workflow.test.ts` - Prisma client browser error
- `tests/components/invoices/invoice-form.test.tsx` - React act() warnings
- `tests/components/auth/login-form.test.tsx` - Mock function errors
- `tests/unit/accounting/currency-basic.test.ts` - Syntax error

### 3. API Tests
**Status**: ❌ Failed to Run  
**Issue**: Tests failed with "Request is not defined" error
**Affected Tests**: 
- `tests/api/auth.test.ts`
- Other API tests exist but were not run due to environment issues

### 4. Test Data Seeding
**Status**: ✅ Success  
**Achievement**: Successfully fixed and ran E2E test data seeding script
- Fixed all schema mismatches
- Created comprehensive test data including:
  - 4 test users (admin, manager, sales, inventory)
  - Company settings
  - Chart of accounts
  - Tax configuration
  - Customers, suppliers, leads
  - Quotations, sales orders, invoices
  - Inventory items and movements
  - Shipments

## 🔧 Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Working:
- Playwright installation completed
- Test database setup and migrations
- E2E data seeding script
- Simple unit tests
- Jest test runner

### ❌ Issues:
- Dev server database connection for E2E tests
- Component test mocking setup
- API test environment configuration
- Some test files have syntax errors

## 📋 Recommendations

1. **Fix Authentication**: 
   - Ensure dev server uses test database properly
   - Debug login API endpoint with test database
   - Consider using a test-specific env file

2. **Fix Unit Tests**:
   - Update mock implementations for router and other dependencies
   - Fix React act() warnings by properly wrapping state updates
   - Resolve Prisma client browser environment issues

3. **Fix API Tests**:
   - Set up proper test environment for Next.js API routes
   - Mock Request/Response objects correctly

4. **Test Organization**:
   - Consider separating integration tests from unit tests
   - Add test categories to package.json scripts
   - Create separate configs for different test types

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Debug and fix E2E authentication setup
2. Fix component test mocking issues
3. Set up proper API test environment
4. Run full test suite once issues are resolved
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
