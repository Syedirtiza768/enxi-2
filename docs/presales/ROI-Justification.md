# ROI Justification

Implementing Enxi ERP reduces manual workload and improves revenue capture. A unified system eliminates duplicate data entry and speeds up invoicing, while real-time inventory helps avoid stockouts that stall sales.

## High-Level Cost/Benefit Points
- **Lower Operating Costs**: Automation of purchasing and accounting tasks cuts administrative effort.
- **Faster Cash Collection**: Immediate invoice generation and payment tracking shorten the cash cycle.
- **Improved Margins**: Accurate landed cost and FIFO inventory reveal true profitability.
- **Reduced IT Spend**: One application replaces multiple disconnected tools and legacy servers.
