## Error Resolution

The "P.map is not a function" error has been resolved by:
1. Adding Array.isArray() checks before all .map() calls
2. Handling nested API response structures (response.data?.data || response.data || [])
3. Providing empty array fallbacks for all array operations
4. Defensive programming in data extraction

3. Navigate to any of the pages above
4. Click "Select or Create Items"
