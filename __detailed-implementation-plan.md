## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development Approach
Following the requirements for TDD:

1. **Write failing tests first** for each feature
2. **Implement minimum code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Ensure comprehensive coverage** across all test types

### Test Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All service interactions
- **API Tests**: 100% endpoint coverage
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user workflows
- **Component Tests**: All UI interactions

### Continuous Testing
- **Pre-commit hooks** for test execution
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing
- **Performance regression** detection
- **Visual regression** testing for PDFs

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Email Integration Complexity**: Start with basic SMTP, enhance later
2. **File Upload Security**: Implement strict validation from day 1
3. **PDF Generation Performance**: Optimize templates and caching
4. **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance throughout

### Business Risks
1. **Workflow Disruption**: Implement in stages with rollback capability
2. **Data Migration**: Extensive testing with production data copies
3. **User Training**: Parallel documentation development
4. **Performance Degradation**: Load testing at each phase

## Success Metrics

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Mirror production setup
- Comprehensive testing with real data
- User acceptance testing
- Performance validation

### Production Rollout
