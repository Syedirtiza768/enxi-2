# Comprehensive E2E Testing Framework Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the Enxi ERP system using Playwright. This framework provides complete coverage of all critical business workflows and establishes a robust foundation for continuous testing and quality assurance.

## ðŸ“¦ What Was Implemented

- HTML, JSON, and JUnit reporting
- Global setup and teardown

âœ… **Project Structure**
```
e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/           # Test data and seed files
â”œâ”€â”€ page-objects/       # Page Object Model classes
â”œâ”€â”€ setup/             # Authentication and cleanup
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test specifications
