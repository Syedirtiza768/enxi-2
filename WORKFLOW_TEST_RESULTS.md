# Workflow Test Results

## Summary

I have verified and fixed the following API endpoints for the complete sales workflow:

### ‚úÖ Completed Endpoints

1. **Quotation Calculations** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/quotations`
   - Calculations are correct:
     - Subtotal: 27,280 AED (200 √ó 130 + 16 √ó 80)
     - VAT 5%: 1,364 AED
     - Total: 28,644 AED

2. **Quotation Revision** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/quotations/[id]`
   - Successfully creates new versions of quotations
   - Maintains version history

3. **Quotation Sending** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/quotations/[id]/send`
   - Updates status from DRAFT to SENT

4. **Quotation Approval** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/quotations/[id]/accept`
   - Requires quotation to be in SENT status
   - Updates status to ACCEPTED

5. **Sales Order Creation** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/quotations/[id]/convert-to-order`
   - Fixed transaction timeout issue by increasing timeout to 20 seconds
   - Successfully converts accepted quotations to sales orders

6. **Invoice Generation** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/sales-orders/[id]/create-invoice`
   - Fixed typo in route handler (`_request` ‚Üí `request`)
   - Requires sales order to be approved first

7. **Payment Recording** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/invoices/[id]/payments`
   - Records payments against invoices
   - Updates invoice status accordingly

8. **Quotation Number Generation** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed race condition in quotation number generation
   - Now uses timestamp + random suffix for uniqueness

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Sales Case Number Generation**
   - Issue: Duplicate case numbers causing creation failures
   - Solution: Added timestamp to make case numbers unique

2. **Sales Order Approval Permission**
   - Issue: Admin user lacked `sales.approve` permission
   - Solution: Created script to grant permission to SUPER_ADMIN role

3. **OrderStatus Enum Runtime Error**
   - Issue: OrderStatus enum not properly loaded at runtime
   - Solution: Regenerated Prisma client and restarted server

4. **Invoice Creation Requirement**
   - Issue: Sales order must be approved before creating invoice
   - Solution: Added approval step in workflow

### üìã Workflow Steps

The complete workflow now works as follows:

1. Create/Get Open Sales Case
2. Create Quotation with items
3. Send Quotation (DRAFT ‚Üí SENT)
4. Accept Quotation (SENT ‚Üí ACCEPTED)
5. Convert to Sales Order
6. Approve Sales Order (requires sales.approve permission)
7. Create Invoice
8. Record Payment

### üîß Scripts Created

1. `/scripts/test-complete-workflow.ts` - Comprehensive workflow test
2. `/scripts/test-workflow-simple.ts` - Simplified workflow test
3. `/scripts/create-open-sales-case.ts` - Helper to create test sales cases
4. `/scripts/grant-admin-sales-approve.ts` - Grant approval permissions

### üöß Pending Items

While not tested in this session, these endpoints should also be verified:

1. **Expense Recording** - `/api/sales-cases/[id]/expenses`
2. **Profitability Calculations** - `/api/sales-cases/[id]/summary`

These endpoints exist and follow the same patterns as the tested endpoints.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Integration Tests** - Create automated tests for the complete workflow
2. **Fix Permission Seeding** - Include all required permissions in database seed scripts
3. **Improve Error Messages** - Provide clearer error messages for permission and status issues
4. **Add Transaction Retry Logic** - Implement retry mechanism for database transactions
5. **Document Required Permissions** - Create documentation for all required permissions per endpoint
